Insights Discovery uses a simple and accessible four colour model to understand an individual’s unique preferences. We measure these preferences based on responses to a short online evaluator. One of the outputs is a 20 page personality profile, which identifies strengths and areas for development.
Insights Discovery has its roots in the work of Swiss psychologist Carl Jung. It is continually validated and refined by the Insights research team to ensure it is always accurate and deeply insightful.
